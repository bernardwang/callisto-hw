## Development Notes

This website is written in Vue.js, specifically using the Vue Webpack [boilerplate](https://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/). I chose this boilerplate because this boilerplate has many features built in, such as SCSS, Autoprefixer for browser cross-compatibility, Babel for ES2015+, and ESLint. I also find Vue.js to be very similar to React while being slightly lighter and faster to prototype with.

Because this assignment is a static page, this boilerplate might be unnecessarily feature rich. However, I was already familiar with it, and I felt this project structure demonstrates how a page like this could scale into a fully featured website.

## Usage
After running `npm install`, the following scripts are provided by the Vue Webpack [template](https://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/)

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run all tests
npm test
```
